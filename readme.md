## Setup (Vercel or Netlify)
1. Deploy this repository to Vercel or Netlify. The links above will get you started.
2. Setup a MySQL database for WordPress to use. [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a great option with a free tier.
3. Update environment variables for your project in Vercel or Netlify with the database credentials. These are used by wp-config.php. The environment variables are:
```
DATABASE
USERNAME
PASSWORD
HOST
```
4. (optional) File and media uploads can be enabled using the included WP Offload Media Lite for Amazon S3 plugin. S3 setup details can be found [here](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-offload-media/doc/amazon-s3-quick-start-guide/). The wp-config.php file is setup to use the following environment variables for use by the plugin:
```
SCALE0_S3_KEY_ID
SCALE0_S3_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Setup (Serverless Framework)
1. Install and setup the serverless framework ([docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started))
2. Run `serverless deploy` to confirm that the Lambda is created
3. Like step 2 above, create a MySQL database and update the environment variables. They can be updated in the `serverless.yml` file and then run `serverless deploy` again.


## Structure
- WordPress and its files are in the ```/wp``` directory. You can add plugins or themes there in their respective directories in ```wp-content```
- `netlify.toml` or `vercel.json` are what directs all requests to be served by the file in `api/index.js`

## Gotchas
- WordPress + the PHP files included by Scale0 take up about 40MB. This puts the deployment size close to the 50MB limit for serverless functions.
